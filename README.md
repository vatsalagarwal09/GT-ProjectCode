# Pathfinding3D

** The primary objective of this project is to implement the BFS Algorithm, Dijkstra Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm to provide a stimulation for finding the shortest path for local consideration. This project can be used for providing navigation facilities for a locality of events like a college fest. Also, since the map can be easily modified according to demand, it provides a greater flexibility at any point of time. Both the organizer of an event as well as the user or participant can modify the map based on certain restrictions and need.

This stimulation project is based on the concepts of Breadth First Search algorithm, Dijkstra Algorithm and A* Algorithm. We will be implementing these algorithms in a way to provide a visualization with multiple features. In the stimulation, we can choose the start and final destination, and create obstacles accordingly.**

### Tools used :

We will be using web development basics to complete the project. Technology Stack used by us will be â€“ Node.js, Express, ES6 JavaScript, Tween, Three along with HTML and CSS.
